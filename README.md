# Game-Of-Connect-Four
This Game-Of-Connect-Four is going to have a slight twist! This will support the traditional 6 x 7 board with connecting four horizontally, diagonally and vertically. This will also support an n x m board with connecting p pieces. You will take these values as command-line arguments ex. python Game-Of-Connect-Four.py -r 6 -c 7 -p 4
